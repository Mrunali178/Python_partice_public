# debugging in python
#import pdb module for debugging in python
#module- Python uses various classes and functions written by developers
# Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) in your code. Letâ€™s break it down step by step, like explaining to a beginner.

# ðŸ”¹ Types of Bugs in Python
# Syntax Errors â†’ Code is written incorrectly (e.g., missing colons : or parentheses ()).
# Runtime Errors â†’ Code runs but crashes due to issues like division by zero or accessing an undefined variable.
# Logical Errors â†’ Code runs fine but gives wrong results due to incorrect logic.
import pdb
pdb.set_trace() #set trace executes code line by line by showing arrow
name=input("enter name: ")
age=input("enter age: ")
age2=int(age)+2
